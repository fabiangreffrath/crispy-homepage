                Crispy Doom is a limit-removing enhanced-resolution Doom source port based on
                <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a>. Its name
                means that its internal 640x400 resolution looks "crisp" and is also a slight
                <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/recipie.html">reference</a> to its origin.
            </p>
            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                Crispy Doom is a friendly fork of
                <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a> that provides
                a higher display resolution, widescreen rendering, removes the
                <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Static_limits">static limits</a> of the Doom engine and offers
                further optional visual, tactical and physical enhancements while remaining entirely config file,
                savegame, netplay and demo compatible with the original.

                    features are available:
                </p>
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Clean Screenshot feature, enabling to take screenshots without HUD elements and even without
                        status bar numbers and weapon sprites at higher screen sizes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Colorized status bar numbers, HUD texts and blood sprites for certain monsters.</li>

                    <li>Randomly mirrored death animations and corpse sprites.</li>

                        flipped level geometry.
                    </li>
                    <li>Players may walk over or under monsters and hanging corpses.</li>
                    <li>Centered Weapons when firing, weapon recoil thrust and pitch.</li>
                    <li>Reports whenever a secret is revealed.</li>
                    <li>Level statistics and extended coloring in the Automap.</li>
                    <li>Playing sounds in full length, and misc. other sound fixes.</li>
                    <li>Demo recording and/or playback timers and progress bar.</li>
                    <li>
                        Demo continue and take-over features, handing controls over to the player when demo playback is
                        finished or interrupted.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most of these features are disabled by default and need to get enabled either in the in-game
                    "Crispness" menu, in the crispy-doom-setup tool or as command line parameters. They are implemented
                    in a way that preserves demo-compatibility with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with
                    Chocolate Doom. Furthermore, Crispy Doom's savegames and config files are compatible, though not
                    identical (see the
                    <a href="https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Compatibility"
                        >Compatibility section in the Wiki</a
                    >), to Vanilla Doom's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crispy Doom strives for maximum compatibility with all "limit-removing Vanilla" maps -- but not Boom
                    or ZDoom maps. More specifically, Crispy Doom supports some select advanced features such as
                    <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ANIMATED">ANIMATED</a> and
                    <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SWITCHES">SWITCHES</a> lumps, MBF sky transfers, SMMU swirling
                    flats and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MUSINFO">MUSINFO</a> -- but neither generalized linedef
                    and sector types nor DECORATE and MAPINFO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many additional less user-visible features have been implemented, e.g. fixed engine limitations and
                    crashes, fixed rendering bugs, fixed harmless game logic bugs, full support for DEHACKED files and
                    lumps in BEX format, additional and improved cheat codes, an improved Automap, and many more! Due to
                    the extra DEHACKED states added from <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF">MBF</a>, Crispy Doom
                    supports
                    <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/84859-black-ops-smooth-weapons-dehacked-mod"

            <h2>Crispness</h2>
            <p>
                Crispy Doom offers a "crispness" menu that allows the player to fine-tune settings to their liking. More
                details are available in the <a class="link" data-to="usage" href="#">usage</a> page.

            </div>
            <p>There are 2 components that are needed in order to be able to play Classic Doom.</p>
            <div id="getting-started-components">
                <h3>A Source Port</h3>
                <p>
                    A <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port">source port</a> is a fan-made modification of the
                    original <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_engine">Doom engine</a> which was open-sourced in
                    1997. These are available for free, and you can grab a copy of the Crispy Doom source port in the
                    <a class="link" data-to="download" href="#">Download</a> page.
                </p>

                <h3>A WAD file</h3>
                <p>
                    While the engine was made available for free, the assets that make up the game (textures, music,
                    maps etc...) were not. You still need an original copy of Doom in order to play the original game.
                    The assets are contained in a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WAD">WAD</a> file. Crispy Doom can
                    play nearly all variants of Doom. If you don't own any, you may download the
                    <a
                        href="http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/non-free/d/doom-wad-shareware/doom-wad-shareware_1.9.fixed.orig.tar.gz"

                    >
                    version of Doom, extract it and copy the DOOM1.WAD file into your Crispy Doom directory.
                    Alternatively, you may want to play Crispy Doom with
                    <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Freedoom">Freedoom</a> and a
                    <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Megawad">MegaWAD</a>.

            <p>
                In addition to the default <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_cheat_codes">DOOM cheat codes</a>,
                Crispy Doom offers additional ones that offer extra variation to the gameplay. Keep in mind that cheat
                codes are disabled on the "Nightmare!" skill level, except for the iddt and idclev cheats.

                variables or text strings, if applicable. Crispy Doom offers the below extra parameters.

                <p>
                    Increase the internal frame buffer's rendering resolution from Doom's original 320x200 to 640x400
                    pixels (default: on).
                </p>

                <span class="command">Widescreen Rendering</span>
                <p>
                    Extend the rendered game scene horizontally to match the screen's aspect ratio (default: off). This
                    feature is only available if "Aspect Ratio Correction" is enabled in the setup tool. Without
                    preserving an aspect ratio, the window could just be resized arbitrarily wide.

                    Update the frame buffer to the game window as soon as possible and interpolate between frames,
                    instead of updating at Doom's original fixed rate of 35 FPS (default: off).

                <span class="command">Enable VSync</span>
                <p>
                    Synchronize the updating of the frame buffer with the screen's own vertical refresh rate (default:
                    on).

                <span class="command">Smooth Pixel Scaling</span>
                <p>
                    Upscale the frame buffer to the game window's resolution by means of linear interpolation (default:

                    Colorize the blood sprites and the sprites of crushed corpses for certain monsters (e.g. green for
                    Barons of Hell and Hell Knights, blue for Cacodemons). Furthermore, render Spectres' blood sprites
                    with the invisibility blur and turn Lost Souls' blood into puffs. Additionally, randomly colorize
                    decorative marine corpses (default: off).

                <p>
                    Prevent one sound effect cutting off the previous one, e.g the chainsaw's idle sound interrupting
                    its own start-up sound. Also, continue playing a sound effect even if the corresponding thing was

                <p>
                    Play all sound effects in mono, i.e. without stereo separation (default: off). While this may limit
                    orientation and enemy localization, it reportedly helps players who quickly feel nauseous.

                <h2>Navigational</h2>

                <p>
                    Obviously, disabling weapon sprite bobbing will render the "Weapon Attack Alignment" feature

                    <li>
                        Centered: The weapon sprite gets centered horizontally and pushed up vertically into its idle

                <p>
                    Move the weapon sprite down and up again after falling down from a certain height to give a more
                    realistic impression of the impact on the floor (default: off).

                <span class="command">Weapon Recoil Pitch</span>
                <p>
                    When firing, give an impression of the weapon pushing up by slightly changing the player's vertical
