                Crispy Doom is a limit-removing enhanced-resolution Doom source port based on
                <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a>. Its name
                means that its internal 640x400 resolution looks "crisp" and is also a slight
                <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/recipie.html">reference</a> to its origin.
            </p>
            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                Crispy Doom is a friendly fork of
                <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a> that provides
                a higher display resolution, removes the
                <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Static_limits">static limits</a> of the Doom engine and offers
                further optional visual, tactical and physical enhancements while remaining entirely config file,
                savegame, netplay and demo compatible with the original.
            </p>
            <p>Its core features are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Enhanced 640x400 display resolution, with the original 320x200 resolution still available in the
                    "High Resolution Rendering: Off" mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Widescreen rendering for using all the available horizontal space of screens with aspect ratios up
                    to 24:9.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uncapped rendering framerate with interpolation and optional vertical synchronization (VSync) with
                    the screen refresh rate.
                </li>
                <li>Intermediate gamma correction levels (0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5).</li>
                <li>Removal of all static engine limits, or at least raising of the less crucial ones.</li>
                <li>
                    Full support for the "Doom Classic" WADs shipped with the "Doom 3: BFG Edition", especially the "No
                    Rest For The Living" episode shipped in the NERVE.WAD file.
                </li>
                <li>Support for all versions of John Romero's Episode 5: Sigil for Ultimate Doom.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Objectives & Features</h2>
            <p>
                Crispy Doom is a source port that aims to provide a faithful Doom gaming experience while also featuring
                some user-requested improvements and enhancements. It is forked off of Chocolate Doom to take advantage
                of its free and open-source code base, portability, accuracy and compatibility with Vanilla Doom.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to the core features mentionned in the
                <a data-to="about" class="link" href="#">homepage</a>, the following optional user-visible and audible
                features are available:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jumping.</li>
                <li>Free vertical looking, including mouse look and vertical aiming.</li>
                <li>Aiming support by a crosshair that may get directly rendered into the game world.</li>
                <li>A new minimal Crispy HUD, displaying only the status bar numbers.</li>
                <li>
                    Clean Screenshot feature, enabling to take screenshots without HUD elements and even without status
                    bar numbers and weapon sprites at higher screen sizes.
                </li>
                <li>Colorized status bar numbers, HUD texts and blood sprites for certain monsters.</li>
                <li>Translucency for certain sprites and status bar elements in the Crispy HUD.</li>
                <li>Randomly mirrored death animations and corpse sprites.</li>
                <li>
                    Command line options to allow for playing with flipped player weapon sprites and/or entirely flipped
                    level geometry.
                </li>
                <li>Players may walk over or under monsters and hanging corpses.</li>
                <li>Centered Weapons when firing, weapon recoil thrust and pitch.</li>
                <li>Reports whenever a secret is revealed.</li>
                <li>Level statistics and extended coloring in the Automap.</li>
                <li>Playing sounds in full length, and misc. other sound fixes.</li>
                <li>Demo recording and/or playback timers and progress bar.</li>
                <li>
                    Demo continue and take-over features, handing controls over to the player when demo playback is
                    finished or interrupted.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Most of these features are disabled by default and need to get enabled either in the in-game "Crispness"
                menu, in the crispy-doom-setup tool or as command line parameters. They are implemented in a way that
                preserves demo-compatibility with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with Chocolate Doom.
                Furthermore, Crispy Doom's savegames and config files are compatible, though not identical (see the
                <a href="https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Compatibility"
                    >Compatibility section in the Wiki</a
                >), to Vanilla Doom's.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crispy Doom strives for maximum compatibility with all "limit-removing Vanilla" maps -- but not Boom or
                ZDoom maps. More specifically, Crispy Doom supports some select advanced features such as
                <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ANIMATED">ANIMATED</a> and
                <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SWITCHES">SWITCHES</a> lumps, MBF sky transfers, SMMU swirling flats
                and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MUSINFO">MUSINFO</a> -- but neither generalized linedef and
                sector types nor DECORATE and MAPINFO.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many additional less user-visible features have been implemented, e.g. fixed engine limitations and
                crashes, fixed rendering bugs, fixed harmless game logic bugs, full support for DEHACKED files and lumps
                in BEX format, additional and improved cheat codes, an improved Automap, and many more! Due to the extra
                DEHACKED states added from <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF">MBF</a>, Crispy Doom supports
                <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/84859-black-ops-smooth-weapons-dehacked-mod">enhancer</a>
                <a

                that can make the gameplay even more pleasing to the eyes. For a detailed list of features and changes
