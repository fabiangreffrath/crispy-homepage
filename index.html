                Crispy Doom is a limit-removing enhanced-resolution Doom source port based on
                <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a>. Its name
                means that its internal 640x400 resolution looks "crisp" and is also a slight
                <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/recipie.html">reference</a> to its origin.
            </p>
            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                Crispy Doom is a friendly fork of
                <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a> that provides
                a higher display resolution, widescreen rendering, removes the
                <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Static_limits">static limits</a> of the Doom engine and offers
                further optional visual, tactical and physical enhancements while remaining entirely config file,
                savegame, netplay and demo compatible with the original.

                    features are available:

                        Clean Screenshot feature, enabling to take screenshots without HUD elements and even without
                        status bar numbers and weapon sprites at higher screen sizes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Colorized status bar numbers, HUD texts and blood sprites for certain monsters.</li>

                    <li>Randomly mirrored death animations and corpse sprites.</li>

                    </li>

                    <li>Demo recording and/or playback timers and progress bar.</li>
                    <li>
                        Demo continue and take-over features, handing controls over to the player when demo playback is
                        finished or interrupted.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most of these features are disabled by default and need to get enabled either in the in-game
                    "Crispness" menu, in the crispy-doom-setup tool or as command line parameters. They are implemented
                    in a way that preserves demo-compatibility with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with
                    Chocolate Doom. Furthermore, Crispy Doom's savegames and config files are compatible, though not
                    identical (see the
                    <a href="https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Compatibility"
                        >Compatibility section in the Wiki</a
                    >), to Vanilla Doom's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crispy Doom strives for maximum compatibility with all "limit-removing Vanilla" maps -- but not Boom
                    or ZDoom maps. More specifically, Crispy Doom supports some select advanced features such as
                    <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ANIMATED">ANIMATED</a> and
                    <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SWITCHES">SWITCHES</a> lumps, MBF sky transfers, SMMU swirling
                    flats and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MUSINFO">MUSINFO</a> -- but neither generalized linedef
                    and sector types nor DECORATE and MAPINFO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many additional less user-visible features have been implemented, e.g. fixed engine limitations and
                    crashes, fixed rendering bugs, fixed harmless game logic bugs, full support for DEHACKED files and
                    lumps in BEX format, additional and improved cheat codes, an improved Automap, and many more! Due to
                    the extra DEHACKED states added from <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF">MBF</a>, Crispy Doom
                    supports
                    <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/84859-black-ops-smooth-weapons-dehacked-mod"
