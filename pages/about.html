<p>
    Crispy Doom is a limit-removing enhanced-resolution Doom source port based on
    <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a>. Its name means that its
    internal 640x400 resolution looks "crisp" and is also a slight
    <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/recipie.html">reference</a> to its origin.
</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>
    Crispy Doom is a friendly fork of
    <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a> that provides a higher
    display resolution, widescreen rendering, removes the
    <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Static_limits">static limits</a> of the Doom engine and offers further optional
    visual, tactical and physical enhancements while remaining entirely config file, savegame, netplay and demo
    compatible with the original.

        In addition to the core features mentionned above, the following optional user-visible and audible features are
        available:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jumping.</li>
        <li>Free vertical looking, including mouse look and vertical aiming.</li>
        <li>Aiming support by a crosshair that may get directly rendered into the game world.</li>

        <li>

        </li>
        <li>Colorized status bar numbers, HUD texts and blood sprites for certain monsters.</li>
        <li>Translucency for certain sprites and status bar elements in the Crispy HUD.</li>
        <li>Randomly mirrored death animations and corpse sprites.</li>
        <li>
            Command line options to allow for playing with flipped player weapon sprites and/or entirely flipped level

        <li>Demo recording and/or playback timers and progress bar.</li>
        <li>
            Demo continue and take-over features, handing controls over to the player when demo playback is finished or
            interrupted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Most of these features are disabled by default and need to get enabled either in the in-game "Crispness" menu,
        in the crispy-doom-setup tool or as command line parameters. They are implemented in a way that preserves
        demo-compatibility with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with Chocolate Doom. Furthermore, Crispy
        Doom's savegames and config files are compatible, though not identical (see the
        <a href="https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Compatibility">Compatibility section in the Wiki</a
        >), to Vanilla Doom's.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crispy Doom strives for maximum compatibility with all "limit-removing Vanilla" maps -- but not Boom or ZDoom
        maps. More specifically, Crispy Doom supports some select advanced features such as
        <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ANIMATED">ANIMATED</a> and
        <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SWITCHES">SWITCHES</a> lumps, MBF sky transfers, SMMU swirling flats and
        <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MUSINFO">MUSINFO</a> -- but neither generalized linedef and sector types nor
        DECORATE and MAPINFO.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many additional less user-visible features have been implemented, e.g. fixed engine limitations and crashes,
        fixed rendering bugs, fixed harmless game logic bugs, full support for DEHACKED files and lumps in BEX format,
        additional and improved cheat codes, an improved Automap, and many more! Due to the extra DEHACKED states added
        from <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF">MBF</a>, Crispy Doom supports
        <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/84859-black-ops-smooth-weapons-dehacked-mod">enhancer</a>
        <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/85991-smoothed-smooth-monsters-for-doom-retro-and-crispy-doom"
            >mods</a
        >
        that can make the gameplay even more pleasing to the eyes. For a detailed list of features and changes please
        refer to the release notes below.

<h2>Crispness</h2>
<p>
    Crispy Doom offers a "crispness" menu that allows the player to fine-tune settings to their liking. More details are
    available in the <a class="link" data-to="usage" href="#">usage</a> page.
</p>
<div class="image-row">
    <img class="modal-image single-row-image" src="./assets/screenshots/menu.gif" alt="cripsness-menu" />
</div>

<h2>Other Games</h2>
<p>
    Crispy Heretic, Crispy Hexen and Crispy Strife are also available and support a subset of the aforementioned Crispy
    Doom features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enhanced 640x400 display resolution.</li>
    <li>Widescreen rendering.</li>
    <li>Uncapped frame rate.</li>
    <li>Removal of static limits.</li>
    <li>Mouselook.</li>
    <li>Increased number of sound channels.</li>
    <li>Brightmaps.</li>
    <li>... and others!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    When using non-4:3 aspect ratios, you may notice that status bars and many weapon sprites are clipped on the
    sides. This is not a bug. It occurs because the original game assets were never designed with wide aspect ratios in
    mind. To fix this, please seek out a community-created widescreen asset pack.
