    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
</div>
<p>There are 2 components that are needed in order to be able to play Classic Doom.</p>
<div id="getting-started-components">
    <h3>A Source Port</h3>
    <p>
        A <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port">source port</a> is a fan-made modification of the original
        <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_engine">Doom engine</a> which was open-sourced in 1997. These are
        available for free, and you can grab a copy of the Crispy Doom source port in the
        <a class="link" data-to="download" href="#">Download</a> page.
    </p>

    <h3>A WAD file</h3>
    <p>
        While the engine was made available for free, the assets that make up the game (textures, music, maps etc...)
        were not. You still need an original copy of Doom in order to play the original game. The assets are contained
        in a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WAD">WAD</a> file. Crispy Doom can play nearly all variants of Doom. If
        you don't own any, you may download the
        <a
            href="http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/non-free/d/doom-wad-shareware/doom-wad-shareware_1.9.fixed.orig.tar.gz"
            >Shareware</a
        >
        version of Doom, extract it and copy the DOOM1.WAD file into your Crispy Doom directory. Alternatively, you may
        want to play Crispy Doom with
        <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Freedoom">Freedoom</a> and a
        <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Megawad">MegaWAD</a>.
    </p>

<!-- cheats -->
<div class="header-with-icon">
    <img src="./assets/icons/shells.svg" alt="shells" />
    <h2>New Cheat Codes</h2>
</div>
<p>
    In addition to the default <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_cheat_codes">DOOM cheat codes</a>, Crispy Doom
    offers additional ones that offer extra variation to the gameplay. Keep in mind that cheat codes are disabled on the
    "Nightmare!" skill level, except for the iddt and idclev cheats.

<!-- command-line parameters -->
<div class="header-with-icon">
    <img src="./assets/icons/terminal.svg" alt="terminal" />
    <h2>New Command-line Parameters</h2>
</div>
<p>
    A command-line parameter is a start-up indication by the user that the engine should change its default behavior.
    The parameters are typed after the executable's name in the command line and are followed by variables or text
    strings, if applicable. Crispy Doom offers the below extra parameters.

<!-- cripsness menu -->
<div class="header-with-icon">
    <img src="./assets/icons/menu.svg" alt="menu" />
    <h2>The Crispness Menu</h2>
</div>
<p>
    In addition to the core additions, the below features can be toggled in-game. Keep in mind that they are implemented
    in a way that preserves demo-compatibility with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with Chocolate Doom.
</p>
<div class="centered-single">
    <span class="toggle-button" data-div="crispness-menu" />

<!-- compatiblity -->
<div class="header-with-icon">
    <img src="./assets/icons/compatibility.svg" alt="compatiblity" />
    <h2>Compatiblity</h2>
</div>
<p>
    Crispy Doom strives for maximum compatibility with all limit-removing vanilla maps, but does not support Boom or
    ZDoom maps. Many additional less user-visible features have been implemented, including repair of game engine
    limitations and bugs, full support for DeHackEd files and lumps in BEX format, additional and improved cheat codes,
    an improved automap, and more, detailed below.
