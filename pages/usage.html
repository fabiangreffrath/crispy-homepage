    in a way that preserves demo-compatibility with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with Chocolate Doom.

<p>
    In addition to the default <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_cheat_codes">DOOM cheat codes</a>, Crispy Doom
    offers additional ones that offer extra variation to the gameplay. Keep in mind that cheat codes are disabled on the
    "Nightmare!" skill level, except for the iddt and idclev cheats.

    <h2>New Command-line Parameters</h2>
</div>
<p>
    A command-line parameter is a start-up indication by the user that the engine should change its default behavior.
    The parameters are typed after the executable's name in the command line and are followed by variables or text
    strings, if applicable. Crispy Doom offers the below extra parameters.
