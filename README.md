## About

This is a work-in-progress homepage for [Crispy Doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom),
a limit-removing enhanced-resolution Doom source port based on [Chocolate Doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom).

[Live Preview](https://kiwphi.github.io/crispy-homepage/)

#### Base goals for the project:

-   Have a minimalistic, yet pretty looking homepage.
-   Avoid having useless text/content. Straight to the point without any bloat.
-   Be super fast to load.

#### Development notes:

In order to avoid using external libraries for simple things, all of the functionality
is built from scratch (image modals, togglable divs, scroll actionsâ€¦).
A static-site-generator might be used in the future if the content becomes too great to manage.
