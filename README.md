## About

This is a work-in-progress homepage for [Crispy Doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom), a limit-removing enhanced-resolution Doom source port based on [Chocolate Doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom).\

Base goals for the project:

-   Have a minimalistic, yet pretty looking homepage.
-   Avoid having useless text/content. Straight to the point without any bloat.
-   Be super fast to load.
